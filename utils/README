* Utils for SNAG

Set of scripts/utilities, helpful for snag.

* move_yml_to_literate.sh
  - Move your .yml code to literate (org-mode) code.
  - Just edit the `dir` variable to point to the directory where your
    yml files are present.
  - Run the script.

  Please note the following cautionary points:
  1. Automated renaming of .yml to .txt in roles/*/{files,templates}
     might have side effects as the code which uses these files wont
     get updated by this automated script
