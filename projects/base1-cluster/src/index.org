* Introduction
We describe here the specification, design and implementation of a cluster of
one machine, the ansible server.

* Requirements of the Cluster

** Functional Requirements of Cluster

Build a cluster consisting of the following:

  - Ansible :: this machine runs the ansible server.

** Security Requirements of Cluster

 1) The only way to reach the network is through ssh and that too from a fixed
    IP network (IIIT).

** Performance Requirements of Cluster

* Design of the cluster
* Implementation of the cluster

The cluster contains the following machines:

 - [[./ansible.org][Ansible]]
 - [[./common.org][Common]]

* Testing of the cluster
