* Introduction:
This document describes the requirements, design and implementation of
the common roles which is part of the cluster. A role is a specific
set of configurations. Common Roles are the roles which will be
applied on all the deployed servers.

* Requirements

The functional requirements for common roles are:

** Functional Requirements

  1. Below common roles are applied at periodic intervals:
    + Restarting the IP tables
    + Installing and configuring the logwatch
    + Disabling password-based ssh
    + Installing and configuring fail2ban for ssh
    + Updating / patching the OS
    + Logging / Modfying the history behavior

The security best practices needs to be followed in defining the
roles. All processes suggested for =hardening a server= should be
implemented. A good documentation can be found here: [[http://www.serverhardening.com/][Server Hardening]].


* Design:

Common roles will ensure that all the common roles will be applied on
all the deployed servers,

* Implementation:
** Structure of the scripts
The implementation of this system is in terms of a collection of
Ansible scripts that configure the machine.  These scripts need to be
organized in a certain way:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|-- ansible.yml
|-- roles
|   |-- ansible
|   |   |...
|   |   |...
|   |-- common
|   |   |-- files
|   |   |    |-- history.sh
|   |   |    `-- sshd_config
|   |   |-- handlers
|   |   |    `-- main.yml
|   |   |-- meta
|   |   |   `-- main.yml
|   |   |-- tasks
|   |   |   |-- aliases.yml
|   |   |   |-- history-config.yml
|   |   |   |-- restart-iptables.yml
|   |   |   |-- logwatch.yml
|   |   |   |-- main.yml
|   |   |   |-- fail2ban.yml
|   |   |   |-- sshd-config.yml
|   |   |   `-- update-os.yml
|   |   |-- templates
|   |   `-- vars
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** History
History parameters will be exported for the following:
 - HISTTIMEFORMAT :: display the time stamp along with the command
                     history
 - HISTSIZE       :: is the number of lines or commands that are stored in
                     memory in a history list while bash session is
                     ongoing
 - HISTFILESIZE   :: is the number of lines or commands that are allowed
                     in the history file at startup time of a session,
                     and are stored in the history file at the end of
                     bash session for use in future sessions.
#+BEGIN_SRC SHELL :tangle ../build/roles/common/files/history.sh
#!/bin/bash
HISTTIMEFORMAT  = "%y %m %d %T"
HISTSIZE        = 100000
HISTFILESIZE    = 100000
export HISTTIMEFORMAT HISTSIZE HISTFILESIZE
#+END_SRC 


*** SSHD Configuration
This file copies the modified sshd configuration and restarts using
the handler.

#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle ../build/roles/common/tasks/sshd-config.yml
 ---
#Role to copy the modified sshd_config and call ssh restart handler
 - name: copy sshd_config
   copy: src=sshd_config dest=/etc/ssh/sshd_config owner=root group=root mode=0644
   notify:
    - restart sshd
