* Introduction

This document describes the requirements, design and implementation of the
ansible server which is part of the cluster.

The Ansible works by configuring servers.   A server may have multiple
roles and a machine is configured for a specific role.    Roles are
build on the idea of include files and combine them to form clean,
reusable abstractions. 

* Requirements

The functional and security requirements for Ansible server are:

** Functional Requirements

  1. Ansible server should manage itself
     + At regular intervals, it should apply firewall rules.
     + At regular intervals, it should update the packages of the OS and other
       software.


** Security Requirements
   1. Apply Firewall Rules.
   2. SSH/Port 22 accessible *ONLY* from VLEAD IP range.
   3. Allow ICMP (Ping)
   4. Limit rate of new connections on port 22.
   
* Design

The design of the firewall rules will ensure that this server is accessible
only via port 22. All other ports are disabled. The port 22 is accessible only
from VLEAD ip range.  Only key-based login to the this server is allowed. This
server can be pinged from anywhere.


* Implementation

The implementation of this system is in terms of a collection of Ansible scripts that
configure the machine.   These scripts need to be organized in a certain way:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

|-- ansible.org
|-- roles
|   |-- ansible
|   |   |-- handlers
|   |   |   `-- main.org
|   |   |-- meta
|   |   |   `-- main.org
|   |   |-- tasks
|   |   |   |-- main.org
|   |   `-- templates
|   |       `-- iptables
|   |-- common
|   |   ... 
#+END_EXAMPLE

We do the implementation in terms of defining suitable scripts for each role.

The top level script resides in =ansible-scripts/ansible.yml=

** Common Roles
Hardening of the machine is done by the common roles.  More information is [[./roles/common/tasks/main.org][here]]

** Specific roles
*** Firewall Rules
Firewall rules are defined [[./roles/ansible/templates/iptables.org][here]]
