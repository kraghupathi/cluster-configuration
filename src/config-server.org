* Introduction
  In this documentation, we call config-server as ansible server,
  configuration server and also node. 
  
  This document describes the requirements, design and implementation of
  the configuration server.
  
  This configuration server plays a vital role in the cluster to complete the
  infrastructure.  Since configuration server configures all other nodes in the
  cluster and configures itself as well, through multiple roles and tasks.  A
  role is a specific set of configurations.

  It contains all the ansible-scripts to bring up the other nodes. The purpose
  of this server is to avoid manual configuration of nodes by team members. The
  mechanism ansible provides to configure other nodes is via ssh.
 
  The configuration server will be able to ssh to other servers and lab
  instances/containers using *key based authentication only* since public key of
  configuration server will be placed in all other
  servers/nodes,instances/containers and itself also. Password based
  authentication is not allowed to this node

  This document also describes the implementation of a python program which
  takes a text file as input and writes the data in yml format into another
  file.

** COMMENT Only from management ip machines, we will be able ssh to root account
of configuration server. Password based authentication is not allowed
to root user, only key based authentication is allowed from specific
ip machines.  

- Note  ::  In future we can have non-root(normal) user to
            ssh to configuration server only from management ip
            machines.

* Requirements
 The requirements of the config-server which differ from the generic
 requirements(specified in common-role) are mentioned here.

** Functional Requirements
   1. Configuration server will configure all the nodes in the cluster
      including itself and ensures that the configuration is
      consistent.
   2. Configuration server has only one `root' user.
   3. Only authorized VLEAD members can login as 'root' user from IIIT
      IP range or management ip machines using key based
      authentication only.
   4. Provide service to register and de-register labs. 

** Security Requirements
   The Configuration server accepts incoming connections on port 22
   *only* from IIIT IP range or management ip machines.
* Design
** Configuration
  The following network diagram represents how the configuration
  server is connecting to other nodes such as reverse proxy, DNS,
  router etc.

  #+CAPTION:  Configuration Server Design Diagram
  #+LABEL:  fig-config-diagram
  [[./diagrams/config-server-network-diagram.png]]
   
  Configuration server is one of the many other nodes in the cluster.
  Only IIIT IP range and management ip machines are allowed to ssh to
  root account of the configuration server.

  The design of the firewall rules ensures that this server is
  accessible only via port 22.  

  SSH access to the node is allowed only via *key-based
  authentication*. Password based authentication is not allowed to the
  root user. SSH configuration, fail2ban and locking root user
  password are taken care by common role. For more tasks which are
  done by common role to the node are described in [[./common.org][common role]].
  
  The Configuration server can be reached via ICMP (ping) requests.
  Public key of the configuration server will be placed in every
  instance/container. So the configuration server will be able to
  configure all other nodes, instances/containers and as well as
  itself by running the ansible scripts. These ansible scripts are
  described and implemented at the [[Implementation][implementation]] section.

** System Configuration files Summary

The following table gives the information about services and their
configuration files. Other configuration files are updated in common role.

* Implementation
** Configuration
  The implementation of the configuration server is done with the
  following steps.
  - Note :: In this implementation, variables are used in various
            places using "{}". Values of these variables are defined
            in [[common_vars.org][common_vars role]].

*** Structure of the scripts
   The implementation of this system is in terms of a collection of
   ansible scripts that configures the machine. The scripts are organized as
   follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|-- config_server.yml
|-- roles
|   |-- config_server
|   |   |-- handlers
|   |   |   `-- main.yml
|   |   |-- tasks
|   |   |   |-- main.yml
|   |   `-- templates
|   |       `-- iptables

#+END_EXAMPLE

   Here =config_server.yml= file configures the configuration server
   with the config_server and all other roles. The other roles are:
    - [[./common.org][common]]
    - rsyslog_client
    - ossec_client
    - nagios_client
    - config_server

   =roles/config_server/handlers/main.yml= file defines various
   handlers which are only executed in case a task notifies
   them. Handlers are described in details at [[Handlers][handlers]].  The handlers
   are called only when tasks are called as part of the config_server
   role. Various templates and files are being used during task
   execution for creating necessary configuration files.

   =roles/config_server/tasks/main.yml= file consist of various tasks
   which are needed for setting up config_server. These tasks are
   implemented and described [[Tasks][here]].
   
   =roles/config_server/templates/iptables= template file consist of
   various firewall rules in order to configure this node securely by
   running the [[Apply firewall rules to Configuration server][task]]. This template uses various variables and these
   variable values are defined in common_vars role. This template is
   created at [[Firewall rules]] section and you can see the description
   each firewall.

*** Tasks

*** Firewall rules
    Rules which are specific to configuration server are described [[Firewall rules specific to config_server][below]].
    Description of each firewall rule of this configuration server and
    which are common across all the systems are described in [[.common.org][common role]].

---
- name: installing ansible
  yum: name=ansible state=present
#+END_SRC
*** Apply firewall rules to Configuration server
    Firewall rules are applied by following steps:
    1) Copy the =iptables= template to the configuration server.
    2) Restart iptables service if the configuration file is modified
       and apply the configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle roles/config_server/tasks/main.yml
- name: Copy iptables configuration file for configuration server
  template: src=iptables dest=/etc/sysconfig/iptables mode=600 owner=root group=root
  notify: restart iptables
#+END_SRC

*** Handlers
   Restart the iptables service if configuration file of iptables is
   modified. These handlers are called only when tasks notifies to
   start service.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle roles/config_server/handlers/main.yaml 
---
- name: restart iptables
  service: name=iptables state=restarted
#+END_SRC

*** Main configuration file
   The configuration server is managed with all other roles. The
   implementation is done in terms of defining suitable scripts for
   each role.  The top level script is =build/code/config_server.yml=

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle config_server.yml

* Test Cases
** Test case ID :: SSH access using AWS KeyPair
*** Objective
    Test to check if SSH is allowed only from IIIT network for the user
    root and denied from other ips using AWS KeyPair
*** Apparatus
    1. Security KeyPair
    2. A workstation with IIIT ips 
    3. A workstation with unknown ip 
    4. Configuration server 
*** Procedure
    1. Assume you are inside the IIIT network.
    2. Create a VM and generate new security KeyPair using AWS console
    3. Place/copy the KeyPair into ssh-tunnel container.
    4. Give 400 permission to that KeyPair and
    5. ssh to config_server from workstation 
*** Experiments
**** SSH to the config_server from management ips/ IIIT ips
    Since configuration server is created using AWS console, KeyPair
    of this server is generated during creation of the VM. So the
    private KeyPair is placed in "ssh-tunnel" container on base2. From
    "ssh-tunnel", only VLEAD members (who have ssh access to
    ssh-tunnel and sudo permissions to root account) can ssh to
    configuration server only from IIIT network.  ssh to configuration
    server using the below command:
    #+BEGIN_SRC example
    ssh -i test.pem root@54.56.34.231
    #+END_SRC
***** Expected result
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Last login: ---Details of last login---
    [root@localhost ~]$
   #+END_EXAMPLE
***** Result
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Last login: Mon Mar 16 02:28:31 2015 from ssh-tunnel.vlabs.ac.in
    [root@config-server~]$
    #+END_EXAMPLE
**** SSH to config_server from workstation with unknown ip
    Suppose a workstation with unknown ip(other than IIIT network ip)
    and it has KeyPair, then try ssh to configuration server from that
    workstation using bellow command:

    #+BEGIN_SRC example 
    unknown-machine$ ssh -i test.pem root@54.56.34.231
    #+END_SRC
***** Result
    #+BEGIN_SRC example
    Permission denied....
    #+END_SRC
*** Observation 
    Configuration server is able accept ssh connection only from
    IIIT/management ips and not from any other machines with unknown
    ips.
*** Result 
    Test is passed. Firewall rules and ssh are configured and applied
    properly. 
*** Conclusion
  Iptables and ssh are configured and applied appropriately. Configuration
  server is able accept ssh connections only from IIIT/management IPs and
  not from unknown ips.

** Test case ID :: SSH access using RSA key
*** Objective
    Test to check if SSH is allowed only from IIIT network for the user
    root and denied from other ips using workstation's RSA key
*** Apparatus
    1. RSA key
    2. A workstation1 with IIIT ips 
    3. A workstation2 with unknown ip 
    4. Configuration server 
*** Procedure
    1. Assume you are inside the IIIT network.
    2. Create a container and generate ssh key using the following command
       #+BEGIN_SRC example
       ssh-keygen -t rsa 
       #+END_SRC
       Provide the passphrase if you need. Else press RETURN for no passphrase.
    3. Place/copy the id_rsa.pub of workstation into configuration
       server's authorized_keys.
    4. SSH to configuration server from workstation.
*** Experiments
**** SSH to the config_server from IIIT ips/management ips
    From "workstation1", only VLEAD members (who have ssh access to
    workstation and sudo permissions to root account) can ssh to
    configuration server only from IIIT network.  ssh to configuration
    server using the bellow command:
    #+BEGIN_SRC example
    workstation1$ssh root@54.56.34.231
    #+END_SRC
***** Expected result
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

**** SSH to config_server from workstation2 with unknown ip
    ssh to configuration server from workstation2 which has unknown
    ip(other than IIIT network ip) using bellow command
    #+BEGIN_SRC example 
    workstation2$ ssh root@54.56.34.231
    #+END_SRC
***** Result
    #+BEGIN_SRC example
    Permission denied....
    #+END_SRC
*** Observation 
    Configuration server is able to accept ssh connection only from
    IIIT/management ips and not from any other machines with
    unknown ips.
*** Result
    Test is passed. configuration is working fine
*** Conclusion
  Iptables are configured and applied appropriately. Configuration
  server is able accept ssh connections only from IIIT/management IPs
  and not from unknown ips.
* TODO
** DONE Add requirements of registering and de-registering labs in the config server.
** Add section for this implementation of the above requirements in the config-server.org. 
** First make the scripts. 
** Write a separate section with code and logic of registering labs in the  config-server.org.
** Write a tasks in playbook to place the code in proper directory, set PATH environment variable.
** DONE Requirements of the hooks::
   - A SSH call from ads server to register.sh script.
   - register.sh then writes data into lab.txt
   - then invokes python program to convert lab.txt into a separate file.
   - Collate entries from models and newly generated file and provide it to
     playbook.
   - then invoke the playbook of setting up server again with updated entries
     or directly call site.yml.
** Separate out the lab entries from the node models. Because in future ads
   will be registering new labs and making changes directly to implementation
   files and those entries could not be updated in the model. So it is better
   to separate out lab entries. Instead we can have only system services
   entries in the model and lab entries could be directly added by ads hooks in
   the implementation files. And playbook collate these entries from two files
   and set the node. 
** Put hooks diagram in the config-server.org
** Create two section in the design one is services and another is configuration.
** In the implementation section create two subsection one is for configuration and other for services.
