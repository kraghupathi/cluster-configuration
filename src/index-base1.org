* Introduction 
This document describes in detail the *Base1 Cluster Model*. It gives
an elaborate description of all the components in the cluster.

* The Base1 cluster model
  This cluster is the staging cluster. This cluster was developed to
  test the functionality of the systems in the cluster before setting
  up a cluster on Amazon. This cluster comprises of several components
  which areas follows:
  - [[./rsyslog_server.org][Rsyslog]]
  - [[./privatedns.org][Private DNS]]
  - [[./publicdns.org][Public DNS]]
  - [[./rp-awstats.org][Reverse Proxy]]
  - [[./nagios_server.org][Nagios]]
  - [[./router.org][Router]]
  - [[./rsnapshot_server.org][Backup server]]
  
* Design of the Base1 cluster
  The diagrams below depict the architecture of the systems in the
  cluster model.
  
** Overall Network Diagram
   The diagram below shows the architecture of the cluster. The
   network setup of the cluster is depicted in this figure.

** Overall connectivity Diagram
   The diagram below shows how the different machines in the are
   connected to each other. It just shows the connection of each
   machine with the other, not specifying the protocol or the port with
   which they connect.
