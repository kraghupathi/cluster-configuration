* Introduction
This document describes the requirements, design and implementation of
the *Private Domain Name Server* which is part of the AWS cluster.
This server is used to provide domain name resolution for all other
servers in the cluster. The name "Private" is a term coined by us to
distinguish the primary functionality of the DNS. This DNS is used for
internal name resolution.  Also it is used for the internal machines
to relove Using Ansible, a machine is configured using multiple roles.
A role is a specific set of configurations.

* Requirements
The functional and security requirements of the Private DNS are
mentioned in the following sections. These are specific the Private
DNS. The requirements which are common to all the roles are mentioned
in the [[common%20role][common role]].
** Functional
   - Resolve our authoritative domain names for all internal clients
   - Zone entries should be configurable (from a particular file on
     ansible server)
   - Resolve all domain names for internal clients (Peer DNS).
** Security
   - Allow port 53 (UDP) *only* from any machine in the cluster.

* Design
** Overall network diagram of Private DNS
#+CAPTION:  Private DNS Network Diagram
#+LABEL:  fig-private-dns-diagram
#+NAME: fig-private-dns-diagram
The following network diagram represents the interaction of the
Private DNS with the other machines in the cluster. This diagram
primarily focuses on the functionality of the Named server. It shows
the various machines in the network to which it provides its service
and also those which are required to help it achieve its
functionality.\\

The Reverse Proxy, Configuration Server and the other machines in the
cluster use the Private DNS for resolving the hostnames of the
machines in the cluster. The Private DNS requires the Router to be
able to contact the root DNS servers for providing the internal
machines to update or install certain packages.

** System files 
The following table gives the information about the services and
their configuration files where modifications are required to setup
the Named Server.

* Implementation
** Structure of the scripts
   - The implementation of this system is in terms of a collection of
     Ansible scripts that configure the machine. These scripts are
     organized as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|-code
|   |-- privatedns.yml
|   |-- roles
|   |   |-- named_server
|   |   |   |-- handlers
|   |   |   |   `--main.yaml
|   |   |   |-- tasks
|   |   |   |   `--main.yaml
|   |   |   |-- templates
|   |   |   |   `--main.yaml
|   |   |   |-- vars
|   |   |   |   `--main.yaml
|   |   |   |-- meta
|   |   |       `--main.yaml
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Installing the bind service
   The BIND service has to be setup for configuring the machine as a
   DNS. This is done by the following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle roles/named_server/tasks/main.yaml
---
- name: Install bind and bind-utils package
  yum: name="{{item}}" state=present
  with_items:
    - bind
    - bind-utils
#+END_SRC

** Configuring the Bind service
   The named server has to be configured. This is done in the file 
   named =/etc/named.conf=. We specify the domain for which this
   server should be the authoritative name server. These are termed as
   zone in the configuration file. Each zone will have a corresponding
   zone file which enlists the sub-domains present in under that
   domain. Here we create a single zone file for one domain
   ie. "virtual-labs.ac.in"

#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle roles/named_server/tasks/main.yaml
- name: Create custom named.conf with desired zone
  template: src=named.conf dest=/etc/named.conf owner=root group=named mode=640
  notify:
    - restart bind
#+END_SRC

** Creating the zone files
   Each zone(domain) is associated with a zone file which contains a
   list of all the sub-domains under that domain and also their
   corresponding IP address to which the request for that FQDN should
   be sent to.

#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle roles/named_server/tasks/main.yaml
- name: Copy zone forward files for all zones to /var/named
  template: src="zone.forward" dest="/var/named/{{item}}forward" owner=root group=named mode=640
  with_items: zone_names
  notify:
    - restart bind
#+END_SRC

** Some more configuration
   We disable the IPv6 support. 
#+BEGIN_SRC  YAML :tangle roles/named_server/tasks/main.yaml
- name: Disable IPv6 support
  lineinfile: dest=/etc/sysconfig/named line='OPTIONS="-4"' regexp="^OPTIONS"
  notify:
    - restart bind
#+END_SRC

** Bringing up the Bind service
   After configuring the named server we now need to start the service.
#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle roles/named_server/tasks/main.yaml
- name: Start and enable bind service
  service: name=named state=started enabled=yes
#+END_SRC

** Building the  firewall rules

#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle roles/named_server/templates/named_iptables

** Apply the firewall rules
   The firewall rules which were mentioned in the previous section
   need to be applied. This is done from the following script.
#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle roles/named_server/tasks/main.yaml
- name: Configure strong firewall on bind/named server
  template: src=named_iptables dest=/etc/sysconfig/iptables
  notify:
    - restart iptables
#+END_SRC

** Handlers
   The services should be restarted if there are any changes made to
   the configuration file. this is taken care of by the following
   code.
#+BEGIN_SRC YAML :tangle roles/named_server/handlers/main.yaml
---
- name: restart bind
  service: name=named state=restarted

- name: restart iptables
  service: name=iptables state=restarted
#+END_SRC
** Putting all in place
   All the above mentioned steps need to be implemented. This is done
   by the main configuration file, which calls all the steps above in
   the required sequence.

* COMMENT Provisioning
  The Private DNS server is setup by the Configuration management
  server. The machine configurations are as described below :

** Creation
   The bare machine to setup a Private DNS is created using the AWS
   console by providing the private IP address.

** Machine Configuration
   + OS :: Centos 6.6
   + Architechture :: x86_64
   + Memory :: 1024MB
   + Disk space :: 25GB
   + Interface :: eth0
** Access 
   This machine can be accessed only by the configuration management server.


* Test Cases
** Test case ID: TC01
*** Objective
    The objective is to test the working of the name server to resolve
    the hostnames of other machines which have been configured in the
    Private DNS zone file.
*** Apparatus
    - The Private DNS container/machine
    - Another machine in the same network
*** Theory
    The named server contains a list of hostnames with their
    corresponding IP addresses. Once the service is running it is
    capable of resolving these hostnames to their respective IP
    addresses. There are command-line tools available which help in
    querying the DNS server. For our test case we use =nslookup= and
    =dig=. Both of them are command-line tools which query the
    DNS. Since this test is being done by the systems engineer, he
    would know the configured IP addresses of the hostnames. This
    helps in knowing if the result of the query is right or wrong.
*** Procedure
    - First we take a another machine in the same network as that of
      the name-server.
    - Now we need to set the name server of this machine to be the
      Private DNS machine that we just configured. For this we need to
      edit the file =/etc/resolv.conf=. The content of the file should
      be as below:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      nameserver <IP of the Private DNS>
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - Now on this machine we need to run the command-line tool to query
      the DNS server. These tools might not be installed on all
      machines by default, so we need to install them.
    - To install the command-line tools we need to do the following:
      for a ubuntu machine
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      sudo apt-get install bind-utils
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      or (for a centos machine)
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      sudo yum install bind-utils
      #+END_EXAMPLE
     - Now we run the tools as follows:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      dig 
      #+END_EXAMPLE
